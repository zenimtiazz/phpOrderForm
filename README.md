Day 1:
:white_check_mark: Validate that the field e-mail is filled in and a valid e-mail address
:white_check_mark: Make sure that the street, street number, city and zipcode is a required field.
:white_check_mark: Make sure that street number and zipcode are only numbers.
:white_check_mark: After sending the form, when you have errors show them in a nice error box above the form, you can use the bootstrap alerts for inspiration.
